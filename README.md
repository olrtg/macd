# Usage

```bash
npx @olrtg/macd ~/dotfiles/macos/defaults.yml
```

This project is for people that wants to have for example a list of defaults for a new macOS in a yaml file. macOS has a way to interact with the defaults of your machine but, there's not a clear explanation of what do what command.
